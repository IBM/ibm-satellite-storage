# Netapp Trident

Trident tightly integrates with Kubernetes to allow users to request and manage persistent volumes using native Kubernetes interfaces and constructs. Itâ€™s designed to work in such a way that users can take advantage of the underlying capabilities of the ONTAP storage infrastructure without having to know anything about it.
This template just deploy Trident, the universal operator, on your target cluster and makes the cluster ready for Ontap-NAS and Ontap-SAN driver deployment.
